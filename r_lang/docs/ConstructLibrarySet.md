# igvfclient::ConstructLibrarySet

Construct library set is a file set that hosts raw data files (e.g. FASTQs) resulting from sequencing of a library prior to its delivery into the samples being investigated. For example sequencing results of guide RNAs after cloning them but prior to their delivery to the actual samples under investigation. The results thus represent the sequencing output of the guides that are then introduced into cells, but may not always correspond to what exact guides ended up being delivered or expressed. Not all construct library sets will end up having FASTQs or any other files in them. For example if the lab chooses not to sequence their guide library prior to delivery, no FASTQs will be required in that case. Construct library sets should not be associated with any samples because they are designed to capture the library prior to its delivery and hence, has no relation to the ample that will get the plasmids eventually.
