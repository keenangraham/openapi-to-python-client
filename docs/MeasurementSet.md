# MeasurementSet

A file set for a distinct measurement, such as the sequencing of a genomic library generated by an experiment performed on a cell line. A measurement set contains the raw data files generated by the measurement.

## Example

```python
from openapi_client.models.measurement_set import MeasurementSet

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of MeasurementSet from a JSON string
measurement_set_instance = MeasurementSet.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(MeasurementSet.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
measurement_set_dict = measurement_set_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of MeasurementSet from a dict
measurement_set_from_dict = MeasurementSet.from_dict(measurement_set_dict)
